# What is Data Structure
- Arrangement of collections of data items to operate efficiently on the data that is stored in the main memory
- Data structures are used by the main memory on the execution of a program to organize data in a way that it can be 
  used and interpreted by the program
- Without data structure we cannot build any useful application

# What is Database
- Permanent data that is stored in the disc organized in a schema of tables
- Data from a database can be accessed by the main memory, organized into datastructures and used by the program to
  keep persistent data being used by the server or client

# What is Data Warehouse
- Data Warehouses are sets of legacy data in databases that are rearranged into new tables with more meaningful 
  information to be later used in data analysis and reports
- These data are stored in the data warehouse by the ETL process the data is exported, then it is transformed and 
  adjusted to fit into the schema model and finally loaded into the warehouse
- Algorithms to read and analyse that data are data mining algorithms
