# Types of Data Structures

## Physical Data Structures
  - Structures that define how data should be organized for storing the elements.
  - Data Structures used for storing values, adding values, searching values, etc...

  ### Array
  - Contiguous allocated in memory, single memory chunk.
  - Has fixed size, so its size is static.
  - Can be created in the stack or the heap.
  - Used when you need to store data of the same memory size and knows how much data you'll store.
    
  ### Linked List
  - Linked List
  - Collection of nodes, that contains the node data and a pointer to the next node.
  - Can grow and reduce dynamically.
  - Always created in the heap.
  - Used when the size of a given list is not known.

## Logical Data Structures
  - Uses physical data structures to store the data that the logic of the structure will work in.
  - Can be implemented using Array or Linked List or a combination of both to store data

  ### Linear Data Structures
  #### Stack
  - Uses LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
  #### Queues
  - Uses the FIFO (First In First Out) principle

  ### Non Linear
  
  #### Trees
  - Is organized like a hierarchy
  #### Graph
  - Collections of nodes and the links between them

  ### Tabular 
  - Hash Table <3
